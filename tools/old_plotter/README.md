# Log Grapher IARC-2019
Graphs csv files generated by logger. Will be phased out with more general plotter.

## Configuration
The log grapher requires a configuration file and a data file.

The config file is read in the format that the config maker generates(xml).

- Log grapher is able to create multiple separate graphs.
- Separate graphs can make use of different time intervals.

The data file is read in the format that the logger generates(csv).

## Operating
When the log grapher is opened a prompt to chose a config file is
opened followed by a prompt to choose a data file. A graph should 
then be displayed if everything goes right.

## Troubleshooting
If you have issues or suggestions, message Cole Dieckhaus or Jon Ogden 
on slack.
