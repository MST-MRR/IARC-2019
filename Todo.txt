Rolling Todos
-Comment code
-Use understandable names for everything
-Add function documentation
-Clean up code
- Test every single function to limits higher than we expect to actually happen -> make sure to test non-visual things

List
- Fix slowdown associated w/ adding metrics -> May need more efficient data structures
- Is there a need for the main data logging in each graph
- Use getters and setters for basic encapsulation
- Config file as xml to determine what functions to use for extra data
- Make wrapper function to request a graph w/ certain data over certain time
- Assertions to catch possible errors before they get too deep -> ie requesting negative time
- Interface for interacting w/ config file
- GUI for manipulating graph(if need more than built in functionality)
- Ability to set breakpoints
