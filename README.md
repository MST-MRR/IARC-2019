# IARC-2019
Autonomous flight code for IARC http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/

## How to Run

From just outside of the IARC-2019 directory:
```python -m IARC-2019.Missions.test_mission```

Alternatively, you can add IARC-2019 to the path python checks so that you can run it from anywhere.

*Note*: The drone hovers in place after it completes its sample instructions. Press ctrl-c to land the drone.
