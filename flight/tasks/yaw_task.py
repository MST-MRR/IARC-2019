class Yaw(TaskBase):
    """
    A task to make the drone yaw to a given heading either relative or absolute.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _has_started : bool
        Indicates whether the drone has started to yaw.
    _new_heading : int
        Stores the given heading after modding it by 360 to keep it in range.
    _yaw_speed : int
        The speed in degrees/sec that the drone performs the yaw.
    _yaw_direction : int
        The direction which you force the drone rotoate: -1 for counterclockwise, and 1 for clockwise.
    __relative : bool
        Stores whether the given heading is relative or absolute: True means relative and False means absolute.
